### 101 👋

I’m developer and kind of designer. Love to learn new stuff in programming and optimizing my life with that knowledge. Specialising on iOS and macOS development. My goal is to become a brilliant specialist in software engineering and make someone’s life a little bit easier with the help of software I make. Also love to pet my imaginary cat.
